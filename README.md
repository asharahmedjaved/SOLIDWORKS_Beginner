# 🚀 SolidWorks Learning Portfolio
This repository documents my journey in learning **3D modeling, assembly design, and simulations** in SOLIDWORKS. I am currently practicing 3D modeling and plan to explore **FEA, CFD, and kinematic simulations** in the future.

## 🏆 Learning Progress
✅ **Basic Modeling**: Sketching, extrusions, revolutions  
✅ **Intermediate Parts**: Threads, lofts, sweeps  
⏳ **Upcoming**: Assemblies, FEA Simulations, Motion Analysis  

## 📌 Featured Models
### 1️⃣ Mold Making 🔩
- **Skills Used**: Core & cavity design, parting lines, draft analysis  
- **What I Learned**: Mold design principles, manufacturability considerations
